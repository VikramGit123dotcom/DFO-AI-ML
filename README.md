# DFO-AI-ML
# Demand Forecasting Optimization ðŸš€
ðŸ“Œ **Project Overview**  
This project predicts sales demand using machine learning techniques to optimize supply chain efficiency.

ðŸ“Š **Dataset**: DataCoSupplyChainDataset  
ðŸ›  **Tech Stack**: Python, Pandas, Scikit-learn, Prophet, Matplotlib, Streamlit  

Throughout this project, we will address two key business questions:

What is the demand forecast for the top-selling product in the next 24 months?
What is the optimal inventory level for the product?
After building and testing the demand forecasting model, we discovered trends, seasonalities and holiday effects on the top-selling product based on the dataset provided we also found the optimal inventory policy for the top-selling product.
